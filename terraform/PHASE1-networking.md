# Phase 1 — Networking

Creates: a VPC with public and database subnets across 2 Availability
Zones, and an Internet Gateway — same pattern as project 3, no NAT
Gateway. Public subnets are also tagged for EKS/Load Balancer
Controller discovery (used in Phases 3-4).

## 1. Review and apply

```bash
cd ~/projects/eks-guestbook/terraform
export AWS_PROFILE=cloud-resume
terraform plan
```

Expect **9 resources to add**: 1 VPC, 1 Internet Gateway, 4 subnets (2
public, 2 database), 2 route tables, 2 route table associations.

```bash
terraform apply
```

Should be fast — no NAT Gateway wait.

## 2. Verify

```bash
terraform output vpc_id
terraform output public_subnet_ids
terraform output database_subnet_ids
```

All three should return real values.

## Verification checklist before moving to Phase 2

- [ ] `terraform apply` completed with 9 resources added, no errors
- [ ] All 3 outputs return real IDs

Once confirmed, we'll move to **Phase 2: the database tier** — RDS
Postgres, same locked-down pattern as projects 2-3.
