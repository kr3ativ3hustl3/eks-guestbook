  # MUTABLE, not IMMUTABLE — a deliberate simplicity tradeoff. This
  # project uses a floating "latest" tag that gets overwritten on
  # every build, with ECS explicitly told to redeploy afterward
  # (Phase 5). A more production-grade pipeline would tag every build
  # with a unique identifier (e.g. the git commit SHA) and update the
  # ECS task definition to reference that exact tag — giving a precise
  # audit trail of what's deployed and making rollback trivial. That
  # approach needs IMMUTABLE tags (an existing tag can never be
  # silently overwritten) plus task-definition-per-deploy logic, which
  # is more machinery than this portfolio project's scope calls for,
  # but worth knowing as the "real" answer if asked in an interview.
