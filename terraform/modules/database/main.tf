# DATABASE MODULE
#
# Creates: a DB subnet group spanning the isolated database subnets,
# a security group with zero inbound rules (the EKS pods' access
# rule gets added in Phase 4, once that security group exists to
# reference), and the RDS Postgres instance itself.

  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_157:Multi-AZ intentionally disabled - doubles RDS cost with no real users to justify it for this portfolio project; documented in docs/architecture.md.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_118:Enhanced Monitoring has a real per-metric CloudWatch cost beyond the free tier - deferred to keep this project's cost at $0 when not actively demoed.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_161:IAM database authentication would require the application itself to generate IAM auth tokens instead of a static password - an app-code change beyond this security-scanning pass's scope, tracked as a follow-up.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_129:Exporting logs to CloudWatch Logs incurs real ingestion/storage cost - deferred to avoid introducing a new billable destination.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_293:Deletion protection would block this project's established terraform destroy-after-verification workflow, used specifically to keep AWS costs at zero between work sessions.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_354:Performance Insights (enabled below, free for the standard 7-day retention) defaults to AWS's managed key for encryption - a Customer-Managed Key costs ~$1/month and is new infrastructure, out of scope for this pass.
  #checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_60:copy_tags_to_snapshot is moot here - skip_final_snapshot=true means no snapshots are ever created to copy tags to.
  #checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_30:Enabling Postgres query logging requires a new aws_db_parameter_group resource - genuinely new infrastructure, out of scope for a zero-new-infrastructure security pass.
